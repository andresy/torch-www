====== What's Torch? ======

**Torch7** provides a Matlab-like environment for state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms. It is easy to use and provides a very efficient
implementation, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language
([[http://www.lua.org|Lua]]) and a underlying C implementation.

**Torch7** is the official successor of [[http://www.torch.ch/torch3|Torch3]] and
[[http://torch5.sourceforge.net|Torch5]].

====== Credits =======

**Torch7** is developed at [[http://www.idiap.ch|Idiap Research
Institute]], [[http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~yann/|New York University]] and
[[http://www.nec-labs.com|NEC Laboratories America]].

At this time, **Torch7** is maintained by
[[http://ronan.collobert.com|Ronan Collobert]] (the dictator),
[[http://www.farabet.net|Clement Farabet]] (the chemist) and
[[http://koray.kavukcuoglu.org|Koray Kavukcuoglu]] (Dr Jekyll). We also use
the great Qt Lua interface from [[http://leon.bottou.org|Leon Bottou]].

If you use **Torch7** for your work, please cite the following paper:

====== Availability ======

**Torch7** is distributed under a [[license|BSD license]]. It runs on Linux, FreeBSD
and MacOS X. With few tweaks, it should also run on Windows (we plan to
support it soon).

See the [[manual:install:|installation manual]] for download and installation details. We do
not provide binaries yet.

**Torch7** git repository is hosted on [[http://github.com/andresy/torch|Github]].

====== Additional Packages ======

We are pleased to share useful contributor packages through the
[[manual:install#the_torch_package_management_system|torch-pkg]]
system. See the list of [[http://www.torch.ch/packages.html|available
packages]] for more details.

======= Documentation ======

[[manual:|Torch7 manual]] is available online, but also in the source
packages.

Also, we have a [[http://groups.google.com/group/torch7|Torch7 discussion group]] where users can post questions and share ideas.

====== News ======

  * **Mars 5, 2012** FreeBSD is now supported. GotoBlas/OpenBlas support added. Torch7 discussion group created.
  * **February 23, 2012** the website is now up! First official release coming soon (we already use **Torch7** in real-life applications!).
